JAVA:
=====

JAva is programming language.

Language:
---------
communicate with each other
eg:telugu,english,hindi...

Programming language:
---------------------
communicate with the machine

machine language...0's & 1's....Binary language.

used to develop....softwares/applications

2types of applications:

1.standalone/desktop applications:
	eg:calculator,antivirus...
	
2.Distributed/network applications:
	eg:gmail,instagram,...
	
2types of programming language:
================================
1.POP:
2.OOP:	

1.Procedure Oriented Programming
	eg:c,b,cobol,....
2.Object Oriented Programming
	eg:java,c++,python,.Net,....
	
oop offers:

1.Performance
2.Security	

OOP paradigm:
=============
1.Inheritance
2.Polymorphism...>>Performance

3.Encapsulation
4.Abstraction....>>Security
	
JAVA:
=====

Java is a object oriented programming language which is used to build both standalone/desktop 

and distributed applications.

History:
=========
developed by sun microsystems in 1995...>>Oracle Corporation.

James Goslings is father of java.

current version :java se 20
standard version: java se 8,11,17

LTS:Long term support.

3Editions of java:
==================
1.JAva Standard Edition(JSE)
2.Java Enterprise Edition(JEE)
3.Java Micro/Mobile Edition(JME)

why JAVA??
==========
1.Platform Independent:
WORA:Write Once,Run Anywhere

Welcome.class.........mac(JDK)
windows(O.S)

2.Garbage Collection....>>Performance
 1000 variables
 2 variables....//998 variables
 
 GarbageCollector:it will collect unwanted memoryspace


Prerequisites to write a java program:
=======================================
1.download java software. ( search jdk downloads)
2.install..... https://www.javatpoint.com/javafx-how-to-install-java
3.we need editors:notepad,notepad++,Eclipse,IntelliJ,netbeans...
4.write a program
5.save the file(.java extension)
6.compile the program
7.Execute

Compilation: converting high level language into machine language
------------
source code...english(18 international languages)

compilation is done by compiler.

source code .....compiler.....byte code.
.java file					.class file

Java Program Structure:
========================
Class <Classname>{

public static void main(String args[]){

//logic

}
}

To compile: javac Filename.java

To Execute: java Classname

Day-2:
======
JDK,JRE and JVM:
================

https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-jdk-jre-and-jvm

Variables and DAtatypes:
=========================
A variable is a container which is used to hold the values while the program is being executed.

>>A Variable is the name for the memory location.

Syn: datatype variablename= data/value; //declaration and initialization

Eg:   int age=25;
   int age; //declaration
   int age= 23;//initialization
   
   DATATYPES:
   ==========
   Datatypes specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable.
   
   2types:
   1.Primitive datatypes
   2.NOn-primitive datatypes(Strings,Arrays,Classes,...)
   
   1.Primitive dt:
    >> 1.Integer.....byte,short,int,long
		2.Float......float,double
		3.Character..char
		4.Boolean....boolean

		1byte=8bits     Range formula: -2^n-1 to (2^n-1)-1   n...bits
	
	D.T				size			Range
===============================================	
	byte			1byte           -128 to 127
	short			2bytes			-32768 to 32767
	int 			4bytes
	long			8bytes
	float			4bytes
	double			8bytes
	char			2bytes			0 to 65535(16 bit unsigned unicode characters)
	boolean			true=1             true/false()
					false=0
					
	String name ="stella"           
	
	variables are of 2types:
	
	1.local variables
	2.global variables
	
	global variables:
	
	1.instance variables
	2.static variables.... static keyword
	
	4proprties:
	
			object: instance of a class.
		
		 classname objref=new classname();//object creation
	
	
		 variables properties:(same for methods as well)
	
	1.syntax:with static keyword we can say static properties,
		 without static it is called instance.
		 
2.memory:static properties will get memory space at the time of class loading into jvm
	     instance properties will get memory space for every object creation
		 
		 what is an object? object is an instance of class. 
		 instance means it allocates sufficient memory space for all class properties.
		 using objects,we can access the complete class data/properties.
		 
3.How to access:static properties can be accessed by using class name
	            instance properties can be accessed by using object reference
				//instance means memory //instanciation memory creation./allocation.
		   
		            classname obj=new classname(); //syntax for obj creation
							A   a = new A(101,abc);// this is how object is created.
							A   b=new A(102,xyz);
							
							(for a class we can have any no.of objects)
							
4.when to use:whenever common properties are required we use static keyword(car parking,school name of students in id cards)
			  whenever unique properties are required we use instance properties.
